IOT BASED AIR POLLUTION MONITORING  SYSTEM USING ARDUINO
The level of pollution is increasing rapidly 
due to factors like industries, urbanization, increasing 
in population, vehicle use which can affect human 
health. IOT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System is 
used to monitor the Air Quality over a web server using 
Internet. It will show the air quality in PPM on the LCD 
and as well as on webpage so that air pollution can be 
monitored very easily. The system uses MQ135 sensor 
for monitoring Air Quality as it detects most harmful 
gases and can measure their amount accurately. 


Here to make an IOT Based Air 
Pollution Monitoring System in which we will monitor 
the Air quality over a web server using internet. It will 
show the air quality in PPM on the LCD and as well as 
on webpage so that we can monitor it very easily. We 
have used MQ135 sensor which is the best choice for 
monitoring Air Quality as it can detects most harmful 
gases and can measure their amount accurately. In this 
IOT project, you can monitor the pollution level from 
anywhere using your computer or mobile. The air 
pollution monitoring device developed in this project is 
based Arduino UNO. The Arduino board connects with 
ThingSpeak platform using ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module. As 
the cities usually have Wi-Fi hotspots at most of the 
places, so the device can be easily installed near any 
hotspot for its operation. The ThingSpeak is a popular 
IOT platform which is easy to use and program. The 
sensor used for monitoring the air pollution is MQ-135 
gas sensor. The sensor data is also displayed on a 
character LCD interfaced in the monitoring IOT 
device. The sensing of data and sending it to the 
ThingSpeak server using Wi-Fi module is managed by 
the Arduino Sketch. The Arduino sketch is written, 
compiled and loaded to the Arduino board using 
Arduino IDE.
